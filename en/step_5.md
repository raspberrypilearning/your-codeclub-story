## Unplugged activity: LLM storytime

While you wait for the LLM to create your podcast, play a fun unplugged game! You'll use dice to make crazy stories, and you'll learn a little bit about how LLMs create sentences.

### Overview:

You're training an artificial intelligence (AI) system called an **LLM** that uses your stories to answer questions, and make a podcast with AI voices. But an LLM like NotebookLM doesnâ€™t actually think, or understand *anything*: it just guesses what should come next in a sentence.

The higher the 'temperature' set for the LLM, the wilder its guesses get. You'll now use dice rolls to generate a story like an LLM and control the story's **temperature**!

### Youâ€™ll need:
- 6-sided die ([or make your own from paper here](resources/dice.pdf){:target="_blank"})
- Pencil
- Handout ([available here](resources/LLMStorytime_creator.pdf){:target="_blank"})

### Be an LLM

**Set the temperature:**

First, roll a die. This will determine which part of the word table below you'll use to create your story:

**1â€“2** \= Low (predictable and safe)  
**3â€“4** \= Medium (balanced and interesting)  
**5â€“6** \= High (random and wild)

### Generate a story

<p style="font-size: 1.4em; text-align: center;">
  In a <span style="color: grey;">[<strong>adjective</strong>]</span> <span style="color: grey;">[<strong>place</strong>]</span>, 
  a <span style="color: grey;">[<strong>person</strong>]</span> found a 
  <span style="color: grey;">[<strong>adjective</strong>]</span> <span style="color: grey;">[<strong>thing</strong>]</span>.<br>
  Curious, they tried to <span style="color: grey;">[<strong>verb</strong>]</span> it, 
  but that only made things <span style="color: grey;">[<strong>adjective</strong>]</span>.<br>
  Moments later, something <span style="color: grey;">[<strong>adjective</strong>]</span> happened 
  when a <span style="color: grey;">[<strong>adjective</strong>]</span> <span style="color: grey;">[<strong>person</strong>]</span> 
  appeared and had to <span style="color: grey;">[<strong>verb</strong>]</span> it immediately!

Next, roll the die for each bold word above, and look up your words in the word table below. 
Your result determines the row (1â€“6) from the word table. Higher rolls \= stranger words.

###  Word table

Once you've generated a story or two, get ready to share one with the group!

Was your story low, medium, or high temperature?

### Discussion

**Whatâ€™s the weirdest verb (doing word) you can think of?ðŸ¤”**

Itâ€™s pretty hard to do! Think about what makes it weird. 
What's the most boring doing word?

**How does temperature affect the story our pretend LLM generated?** 

When you talk about the temperature of an LLM like ChatGPT, what youâ€™re really talking about is how random and strange the words it will use are. Lower temperature means it will use more likely and normal words in its output, while higher temperature means weirder, less likely words.

By now, your podcast should be ready to listen to!
