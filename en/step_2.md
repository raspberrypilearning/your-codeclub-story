## Write your Code Club story

You’re going to write your answers in a plain `.txt` file using a basic text editor. Follow the steps below.

## Step 1: Open a text editor

Use the writing software recommended by your club leader. This might be an online service like Google Docs or Teams, or you might be using a plain text editor on your computer.

Open your chosen text editor.


Choose your device to find out how to open a plain text editor on your computer:

Open the application menu and search for `Leafpad` or `Gedit`.

## Step 2: Answer the writing prompts

Choose **two or three** of these prompts, or use the ones your club leader has chosen. You don’t need to answer them all — just pick the ones that feel most ‘you’:

### Writing prompts
--- task ---

* What’s the coolest thing you’ve ever made in our Code Club?
* What makes our Code Club different from any other?
* If our Code Club had a motto or catchphrase, what would it be and why?
* Who are the characters in our club story? (people, inside jokes, traditions, mascots)
* What’s one day in Code Club that stands out? Why?
* If you were introducing our Code Club to someone on a podcast, what story would you tell?
* How do you feel when you walk into our Code Club space?

--- /task ---

Start with your first name and a quick “About me” line at the top, like this:

```text
First name: Ava

About me:
I’ve been coming to Code Club for about six months. I love Scratch, especially making games and glitchy animations.
```

Write your answers in your normal voice - like you're talking to someone who's never been to your club before.

### Need help writing?
You can ask your leader to help you write your answers down, or you can try using one of these tools to turn speech into text:

- [galaxy.ai](https://galaxy.ai/ai-transcription)
- [evernote.com/ai-transcribe](https://evernote.com/ai-transcribe)

You can also record your answers on a phone or tablet and ask your leader or a parent to help type them up.`


## Step 3: Save your writing

--- task ---

Click File > Save
