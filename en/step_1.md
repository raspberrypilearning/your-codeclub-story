## What you will make

A `.txt` file containing your answers to a few simple prompts about your Code Club.

Your leader will collect everyone’s `.txt` files and feed them into an AI system called **NotebookLM** that turns your words into a podcast that sounds just like the real thing!

You don’t need to record anything. You don’t need to be a professional writer.

You just need to tell us about your Code Club, in your own words.

### Tell your story

This is your chance to share what Code Club means to you.

You’ll write about your club - what you love, what you remember, what makes it yours. 

Then, your writing will become a real podcast, and a fun, shareable story about your club!

Let's get started!
